        /* 
        operators are very useful in js programming language
        they are used to perform operations on variables and values
        maily we have to focus on two terms 
        1.operands - values
        2.operators - symbols
        operators are 7 types
        1.Arithmetic Operators  + - * 
                                / (it gives quotent) 
                                % (it gives remainder)
        2.Unary Operators       ++ --
                                ++ Increment in this two types 
                                1.pre-increment(++a) 
                                2.post-increment(a++)
                                -- decrement two types
                                1.pre-decrement(--a)
                                2.post-decrement(a--)
        3.Relational/Comparision operators == === < > <= >= !=  it gives output in the form of only boolean values
                                           == check only value
                                           === check value along with data type also 
        4.Assignment operators  = += -= *= /= %=
                                first it do operation and output will store in that variable only
        
       
        5.Ternary/Conditional operators - why these are also known as ternary means there are three operand we are used
                                          why these are also known as conditional means there is a condition also
                                          (condition)?(Expression1):(Expression2)

        6.logical operators  - && logical and
                                c1  c2  R
                                T   T   T
                                T   F   F
                                F   T   F
                                F   F   F
                               || logical or
                               c1  c2  R
                               T   T   T
                               T   F   T
                               F   T   T
                               F   F   F
                               ! logical not
                                c1  R
                                T   F
                                F   T
        7.Bitwise operators  - mostly u used this is for conversion of noraml data into encrypted data
                               if u want to encrypt any data then we can use this method because in this method data is conveted into binary
                               then binary data human can't understand only machine can understand
                               for example whatsapp no otherparties can be see ur msgs
                                first u want to learn about decimal to binary conversion
                                
                                & bitwise and
                               | bitwise or
                               ^ bitwise xor
                               ~ bitwise not

        //bitwise operators
        //in this first decinal numbers are converted into binary numbers and then apply corresponding symbol truthtable for result and then that will be converted again into decimal result as final result 
        let p=10; //1010               
        let q=12; //1100
        console.log(p&q); //8   - 0000
        console.log(p|q); //14  - 1110
        console.log(p^q); //6   - 1110
        console.log(~(-4));//3  - 0011
