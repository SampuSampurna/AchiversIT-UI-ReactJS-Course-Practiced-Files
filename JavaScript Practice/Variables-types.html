        Variables - used to store the data
        syntax    - varable_keyword variable_name = variable_value
        There are three types of variables
        1. var    - re-declare and re-intialization is possible  
                    old version
        2. let    - re-declaration is not possible and re-intialization is possible
                    latest version
        3. const  - reclaration and re-intilization is not possible 

        Rules to create variablenames:
        1.starts with a-z or A-Z or _or$ only
        2.can be camesCase - eg.FirstName
        3.case sensitive
        4.dont use keywords for variable names

       () -> braces
       [] -> brackets
       {} -> paranthesis 

       console.log() - we can see output in console itself
       document.write() - we can see output in webpage itself 
        */

        var a; //declaration
        a=10;  //intialization
        console.log(a); //we can write document.write(a) also but prefarred method is console.log() because if any errors are are we can rectify also 

        let b=20;   // declaration and intialization also done in one line to reduce no of lines 
        console.log(b);

        const c=40;
        console.log(c);
