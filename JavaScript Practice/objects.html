    <!-- data storage techniques - there are 3
                                    1.string
                                    2.array
                                    3.object
                                    
    Objects - these are used to store data in format of key:value within {}
    we can store large size of data like student data base and can be access by key 
    object are of also has nested object means one object within the object and each object is seperated by comma(,)
    and after last property we dont need any comma and after the object keep comma for better understanding
    object can be accessed by using the . operator 
    . dot is a special operator named as member
    in two way we can acces objects values
    1.using normal way each individually every time console.log()  we use .operator to access
    2.using for loops  here we should use [] because . dot operator not works here 
    
    adding- we can add elements 
            syntax: 
                 object_name.new_key=new_value
    deleting- we can delete elements 
            syntax:
                  delete object_name.new_key

    three methods are there
    1.object.key(object_name) - to print the keys of the object
    2.object.values(object_name) - to print the values of the object
    3.object_name.hasOwnProperty("key") - to check that key value is present or not if it present returns true otherwise it gives false
