   /* 
   loops - loops are used to iterate block of code until condition if fails
   there are 5 types:
   1.for loop    - syntax:
                     for(intialization,condition,increment/decrement){
                     //block of code
                     }
   2.for in loop
   3.for of loop
   4.while loop  - syntax:
                   intialization;
                   while(condition){
                   //block of code
                   } 

   5.do while loop - syntax:            
                     intialization;
                     do{
                     //block of code
                     }while(condition)
    while vs do-while: while loop is entryflow means first it check the condition later it will excute and 
                    do-while loop is exitflow means first it excutes and later it will check for the condition

    conditional statements vs loops:
      conditional statements excutes block of code  only one time whether if condition true it excutes if block or else block
      while loops excutes block of code multiple times until condition is false it is iteratable.
    
    for loop vs while loop vs do-while loop:
    1.syntax - for three loops syntax is difference
    2.for loop and while loop are entry flow means first check the condition if it true then only it excutes block of code
      do-while loop is exit flow means first excutes block of code then if check the codition 

    two main keywords:
    break    - it comes out from the block of code means after break it wont excutes
    continue - it skip the one iteration when condition true

    break vs continue:
    break is used to comes out from the block of code while continue is to skip purpose only
