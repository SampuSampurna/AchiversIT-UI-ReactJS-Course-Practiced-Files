        Data types -  used to know variable stored data is belongs to which type
        mainly two types of data 
        1.primitive data type      -also known as primary data type
                                    store only single values we cant store multiple values
                                    these are 5 types
                                    1.number    - not only positive numbers and also decimal numbers, negative numbers also
                                    2.string    - combination of character not only alphabets and also digits also 
                                                  mandatory to keep values in single or double quotes
                                    3.boolean   - it has only two values 
                                                  1.true  - valide
                                                  2.false - not valide
                                    4.undefined - it occurs when there is no value
                                    5.null      - it means nothing, no value inside the varibale name and if u check the data type means it gives object 
                                                  because null means there is nothing then we can store any data type values
        2.non-primitive data type  -also know as non primary data types
                                    store multiple values
                                    these are 3 types
                                    1.array           - we can store multiple values of different data types not only same data types
                                                        accessed by using index , and index start from zero and total length of array is n-1
                                                        syntax for accesed first value in array :arr[0]
                                    2.object          - we can store values as key:value pairs
                                                        accessed by using key, 
                                                        syntax for accessed for first value in object :obj.key
                                    3.arrays of object- combination os both arrays and objects
                                                        there are no of objects inside the array
                                                        arr[0].key

        console.log(typeof validation);

        //undefined
        let b;
        console.log(b);  //undefined   because we didnt intialize any value

        //null
        let x=null; //dont use any '' "" null means nothing
        console.log(x); null;
        console.log(typeof x);  //it gives output as undefined because nothing means we can store value of any data type


        //non primary data types
        //array
        let arr=[10,20,30,"Sampu",true];  //data seperated with comma ,
        console.log(arr);   //acess entire array

            data2={no:2, name:'balu', age:22},
            data3={no:3, name:'sandhya', age:22},
        ]
        console.log(array_of_object);  //acces entire array of objects
        console.log(typeof array_of_object);
        console.log(array_of_object[0].name);  //accessed first object's name value
        console.log(array_of_object[2].age);    //accessed third object's age value
