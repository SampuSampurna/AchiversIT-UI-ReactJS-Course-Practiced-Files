    Event Flow - the event will occurs in flow only either top-bottom/bottom-top
    Event BUbbling: (ChildToParent/ButtonToTop)
    In this take example of take glass of water/cooldrink in this the water bubble are from bottom to top
    coming to subject in this also there are so many section like nested sections/div in that sections also coming from last to fast/child to parent
    
    Event Capturing: (ParentToChild/ButtonToBottom)
    take example of photo capturing , 4 members are taking self then only first person face is clearly and remaining all are less quality
    like that top to bottom/parent to child only

    note - go with only any one in event bubbling or event capturing but recommened one is event bubbling
           event bubbling vs event capturing
           use stopPropogation to stop occuring the other elements in both
    1.bubbling-child to parent  capturing-parent to child
    2.bubbling -  in addEventListner we didnt anything specify as third parameter by default it has only false
      capturing - we pass true as a third parameter
