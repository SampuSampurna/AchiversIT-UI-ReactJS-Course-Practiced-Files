    oops - Object Oriented Programing system/Structure
    in oops mainly terms we used adn we should know about 
    1.class        - classes are the blueprints of objects 
                    in real time if u want to construct building/house u must required plan/sketch like same here also class is the blue print 
                    class has methods and properties
    2.objects     - objects are instances of class 
                     to create object new keyword is mandatory 
                     new keyword is used to allocate a memory 
                     object names is always in small letters only
    3.Abstraction - hiding complex code and display only which ever the required only
    4.encapsulation - combination of methods and properties 
                      simple class having methods and properties is the best example of encapulation
    5.inheritance   - acquiring / inheriting / accessing/ properties and methods from the parent to child
    6.polymorphism  - poly means many and morphism means form , polmorphism means many form 
                      
                      1.methodoverriding - same method in parent and child class
                      2.methodoverloading - same method with different parametes
    constructor() - it is default method/function, it can be automatically excuted without calling
    super - it is special keyword ,it is used to access the parent methods and properties inside the child class

        class Parent{
                constructor(name,age){
                    this.name=name;
                    this.age=age;
                }
                display(){
                    console.log("name is "+this.name+" and age is "+this.age);
                    }
        }
        class Child extends Parent{
            constructor(name,age,city){
                super(name,age);
                this.city=city;

            }
            show(){
                console.log("city is "+this.city);
            }
        }
        let c=new Child('sampu',20,'bgl');
        c.display();
        c.show();
